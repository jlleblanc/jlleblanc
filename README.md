I first learned to code on a Zenith computer Dad brought home from work. It had this built in blue LCD monitor and ran on 5 1/4" floppy disks. He used spreadsheets for work and I was interested. We spent about an hour going over macros together and I took off from there.

Long after the Zenith died (a horrific tale involving a misplaced envelope and ventilation slats), the open-source content management system Joomla! landed in the center of my attention. I found myself writing a book about Joomla programming, authoring video tutorials about Joomla for lynda.com, giving Joomla talks, and helping organize Joomla conferences.

Since my time in the Joomla community, I've picked up Node, Rails, React, and other frameworks. I'm currently managing a software engineering team at [True Link Financial](https://www.truelinkfinancial.com) and working on a few hobby-projects as well.
